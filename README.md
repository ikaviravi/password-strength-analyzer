# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator

This project is part of a cybersecurity internship focused on demonstrating password security awareness and dictionary-based attack simulations using Python.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To analyze password strength using zxcvbn and generate personalized wordlists using user-specific inputs like name, DOB, and pet name — simulating real-world brute-force attack scenarios.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- zxcvbn-python
- itertools
- datetime
- Basic File I/O

## 📌 Features

- Analyze password strength and crack time
- Display warnings and suggestions for improvement
- Accept personal info and generate a smart wordlist
- Save custom wordlist to `.txt` file
- Educate users on password vulnerabilities

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open terminal and check for python is installed or not.
2. Next install "zxcvbn" tool using python (pip install zxcvbn nltk argparse)
3. Write python code for password strength analyser and wordlist generator
4. Run the code in terminal (python3 python_file_name.py)
5. Check for results obtained and wordlist generated.
